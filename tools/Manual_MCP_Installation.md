# Manual MCP Installation Guide

## üö® QUICK SETUP (While Testing Segments)

Since the sudo commands need your password, here's how to manually install the Remote Script:

### Step 1: Copy Remote Script Files
1. **Open Finder**
2. **Navigate to**: `/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/`
3. **Create new folder** called `AbletonMCP`
4. **Copy all files** from `/Users/megmac/Documents/Cline/MCP/ableton-mcp/RemoteScript/` into the new `AbletonMCP` folder

### Step 2: Restart Ableton Live
1. **Quit Ableton Live** completely
2. **Restart Ableton Live**

### Step 3: Configure in Ableton
1. **Go to**: Live ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Link, Tempo & MIDI
2. **In Control Surface dropdown**: Select "AbletonMCP"
3. **Set Input/Output**: Choose any available MIDI port (doesn't matter which)
4. **Click OK**

### Step 4: Test MCP Connection
Once configured, the MCP tools should work and you can:
- Load your original mix into Ableton
- Use MCP to create initial slices at your timestamps
- Fine-tune in Ableton's interface for NFL precision

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE: Use Segments Approach
Since you're testing the segment slicer now, you can:
1. **Import all 30 segments** into Ableton manually
2. **Arrange them** in the order you want
3. **Fine-tune timing** using Ableton's tools
4. **Export exact NFL timings**

This gives you the same professional control without needing the MCP connection!
